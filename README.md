# Starcraft Scion Custom Races Round Robin Observer
Starcraft Scion Custom Races Map for playing Round Robin 1v1 matches 

This project is a fork of the Peep Mode project
https://github.com/Kelzorz/PeepMode

It also uses the fantastic Scion Custom Races mod by Solstice

This project is a hobby project of mine, the code's a bit of a mess. 
Despite that, this map seems to have generated enough interest among gamers that I've decided to upload it here.
